# Datepicker
 required to create a simple datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker, but a static UI component that you can later enhance with JavaScript.  The goal of this project is to help you practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS. Below is a rough mockup showing the datepicker UI you need to create.
